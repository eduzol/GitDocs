It is important to know how to use a distributed version control management system.

In git's case, there are two repositories. A local repository and a Remote Repository.
This allows user to keep modifying their documents even when they are offline.Later on, they can push their changes
into the remote repository.This architecture makes possible to use git in several ways.For example, it is possible to use
a centralizaed approach in which users work in their local repository and, after testing, push their changes to a common remote
repository. Another approach is to use a public repository for every user and before changing documents pull all the 
changes of the users into the local repository.

Finally there is a hybrid approach in which there is a centralized repository that is populated from the users
public repositories.
